# Bash Jail Challenges

A collection of bash jail challenges created by 0xnil. These challenges focus on escaping restricted shell environments and bypassing command restrictions.

## What are Bash Jail Challenges?
Bash jail challenges are security exercises where you're placed in a restricted shell environment with limited access to commands, binaries, and system resources. The goal is to find ways to break out of these restrictions and execute arbitrary commands, similar to how attackers might try to escape restricted shells in real-world systems.

## Real-World Applications
Understanding bash jail escapes is crucial for:

### System Security
- Bypassing restricted shells in shared hosting environments
- Escaping chroot jails in Linux systems
- Understanding privilege escalation techniques
- Preventing command injection in shell scripts

### Web Application Security
- Exploiting command injection vulnerabilities
- Bypassing input validation in shell-based applications
- Understanding how to chain commands for exploitation
- Preventing RCE in web applications that use shell commands

### Container Security
- Escaping Docker containers
- Bypassing Kubernetes pod restrictions
- Understanding container breakout techniques
- Securing containerized environments
