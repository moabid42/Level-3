# JS Jail Challenges

A collection of JavaScript jail challenges created by 0xnil. These challenges test your ability to break out of restricted JavaScript environments and bypass security restrictions.

## What are JavaScript Jail Challenges?
JavaScript jail challenges are security-focused exercises where you're placed in a restricted JavaScript environment with limited access to functions and objects. The goal is to find ways to escape these restrictions and execute arbitrary code, similar to how attackers might try to break out of sandboxed environments in real-world applications.

## Real-World Applications
Understanding JavaScript jail escapes is crucial for:

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation
- Bypassing Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions
- Escaping JavaScript sandboxes in web applications
- Understanding DOM-based XSS exploitation techniques
- Preventing XSS attacks in modern web applications

### Node.js Security
- Exploiting prototype pollution vulnerabilities
- Bypassing module restrictions in Node.js applications
- Understanding how to escape Node.js sandboxes
- Preventing RCE in Node.js applications

### Browser Security
- Exploiting browser extension vulnerabilities
- Bypassing same-origin policy restrictions
- Understanding web worker sandbox escapes
- Securing client-side JavaScript applications
