# Python Jail Challenges

A collection of Python jail challenges created by 0xnil. These challenges focus on escaping restricted Python environments and exploiting Python's built-in functions and modules.

## What are Python Jail Challenges?
Python jail challenges are security exercises where you're placed in a restricted Python environment with limited access to built-in functions, modules, and system calls. The goal is to find ways to break out of these restrictions and execute arbitrary code, similar to how attackers might try to escape sandboxed environments in real-world applications.

## Real-World Applications
Understanding Python jail escapes is crucial for:

### Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
- Bypassing restrictions in Jinja2 templates
- Exploiting template engines like Mako, Django templates
- Understanding how to escape sandboxed template environments
- Preventing RCE in web applications using template engines

### Web Application Security
- Exploiting Python-based web frameworks (Flask, Django)
- Bypassing input validation in Python web applications
- Understanding how to chain Python built-ins for exploitation
- Preventing code injection in Python web applications

### Cloud Security
- Escaping containerized environments
- Bypassing serverless function restrictions
- Understanding Python sandbox escapes in cloud environments
- Securing Python-based cloud services
